   Zombie Shooter(The Walking Zombie)
</h1> 

   A project called Zombie Shooter is a 3rd person shooter game🔫. The essence of which is to hold out as long as possible at the military base, shooting back from zombies🧟‍♂️ that come in waves. The player is given about 20 types of weapons to choose from, each of which is good in its own way (except for pistols😅).

There are 3 types of zombies in the game:
  - Mini zombies. This zombie has good speed but is easy to kill as it has low health.
  - Zombie Medic. This zombie has medium speed but is not that easy to kill as it has more health than mini health zombies.
  - Zombie Boss. This zombie has low speed, but it is very hard to kill him, because he has a lot of health.

</p>This is one of my first handmade projects. I tried to make it in low poly style, but it was not successful, because there was not enough free material. The game is made for Android devices, but it is not fully optimized and, unfortunately, slows down on phones. I added a script that can increase the maximum FPS on phones from 30 to 300, but it won't help much.</p>
